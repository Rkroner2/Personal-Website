                </li>
                <br class="push">You will see two columns of lights. On the right there is a column of red lights. On the left there is a column of green lights. Both of these columns are followed by a blue light, and a gold light. On the very bottom of each column is a button.</br>

                    <b>How should I hold the game?</b>
                </li>
                <br class="push">Place the arduino on a flat surface, like a flat desk or a table. Put your right pointer finger over the right button, and your left pointer finger on the left button.</br>

                </li>
                <br class="push">Plug the wire in both the arduino and your computer. Make sure your computer has the appropriate programming for this game to run.</br>

                </li>
                <br class="push">When you turn the game on, the top right light will turn on. The light will slowly move down the column. Once the light reaches the blue bulb, you press the button. If your press the button in time, the yellow bulb will shine. Then, this will repeat one the left side.</br>

                    <b>What else should I know?</b>
                </li>
                <br class="push2">As you correctly press the button on time, that column you correctly pressed on will speed up. Missing a button will cause the lights on that column to move slower. This might cause both sides to go out of sinc, making the game harder. There is a maximum and minimum speed the lights will move.</br>
